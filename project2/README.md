# Star Wars react-project
This react project was a group effort that helped me and my team understand how to cmmunicate and work on the same project effectively.
The project utilizes the following React functions/capabilties:
* useState is used to properly load the data correctly
* useContext is used to add certain characters to a favorites list, and displya them on the Favorites page
* useEffect is used to fetch the correct API call to SWAPI
* Nested routes are used for proper navigation through the site
* Bootstrap is sued for the styling

## Overview
This was my first full React project done with a team. It helped me understand the SDLC while working within a team. We were able to create an effective interface for users. And also take responsibility on ourselves to independently create the neccesary functions of the interface.
