# Springboot-Docker-project
This project ensures that the data that is within the database is secure and drives least privelege for all users. Non admins have limited access while admins have elevated access to view the data.
I was inspired to create this project becasue security is the most important aspect when dealing with personal information and sensitive data.

## Overview
This project is the first of mine using secure practices to ensure users do not have access to private information. Tokens are used to authenticate users to check
if a user has admin capabilities.
The specifics of this project include the following:

* Create a database of users using Sequelize
* JWT to manage secrets and tokens
* Middleware for authorization
* API endpoints that utilize CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
