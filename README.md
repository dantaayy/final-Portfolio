# Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2022 - 2023 apprenticeship at AMEX sponsored by Multiverse.

## Overview of Apprenticeship
During my apprenticeship with Multiverse and 2 different AMEX teams as a Sotware Engineer, I learned the importance of security design, least privelige, SDLC
and how to navigate through a large code base. I have been able to resolve multiple tickets for my team that not only drives our user experience, but also
pushing least privelege through the whole company.

For security reasons, for any code snippets that are shown, please note they have nothing to do with Amex and they are projects that have helped me
become a better Software Engineer that I have worked on through out this Apprenticeship hosted by Multiverse.

## Portfolio Introduction
- My name is Dante Zelaya and I am born and raise in Tucson, AZ.
- I became a Software Engineer thanks to Multiverse, but I specifically am insterested in the Security side after watching movies and seeing how the movies show
  the actors hacking systems, or blocking others from being able to hack them.

## Technical Projects
- Springboot Docker Project
- Star Wars React Project
- Backend Authorization Project
