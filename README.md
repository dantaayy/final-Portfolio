# Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2022 - 2023 apprenticeship at AMEX sponsored by Multiverse.

## Overview of Apprenticeship
During my apprenticeship with Multiverse and 2 different AMEX teams as a Sotware Engineer, I learned the importance of security design, least privelige, SDLC
and how to navigate through a large code base. I have been able to resolve multiple tickets for my team that not only drives our user experience, but also
pushing least privelege through the whole company.

For security reasons, for any code snippets that are shown, please note they have nothing to do with Amex and they are projects that have helped me
become a better Software Engineer that I have worked on through out this Apprenticeship hosted by Multiverse.

## Portfolio Introduction
- My name is Dante Zelaya and I am born and raise in Tucson, AZ.
- I became a Software Engineer thanks to Multiverse, but I specifically am insterested in the Security side after watching movies and seeing how the movies show
  the actors hacking systems, or blocking others from being able to hack them.

## Technical Projects
- Springboot Docker Project
- Star Wars React Project
- Backend Authorization Project

## On the Job Skills learned
- Understanding all stages of Software development when it comes to building, testing, then deploying by working through tickets.
  Multiple tickets have been resolved and deployed into production to help customers and other teams successfuly complete their tasks by maintaining
  proper privilege.
- Following team/company standards when it comes to making changes to code in production by first making the changes in lower test environments, and validating
  the change before moving to production.
- Debugging code by adding logs to narrow down where issue is happening. When a ticket is raised and I am assigned to it. I go and add logs to the code
  and check the logs to see where the error is occuring to the exact line in the codebase. Once the error is identified I analyze why the error is occuring,
  implement the change, then test the change. Once I have completed my own validated tests, I will hand over to testing team to re validate before making
  the release into production.
- Working with up to date Java version, and the technology we use to implement Least Privilege through out the company
- Certain tickets require the use of algorithms to ensure user have correct access, and only certain users can make certain changes. This drive the teams main focus of least privilege
- Working in a team of highly knowledgeable experts and learning a large code base, being able to effectively communicate through slack, or Webex has been a big part of how
  I have been able to navigate and help the team in an effective way. It has also shown my team I am  not afraid to ask questions for help or on guidance. They are also well aware
  of where I am in the process of my fixes as I share updates on my progress.
